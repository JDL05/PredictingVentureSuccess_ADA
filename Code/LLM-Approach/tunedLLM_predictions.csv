"Company Details: Organization Name: Simplifa; Industries: ['Property Management', 'PropTech']; Headquarters Location: Berlin, Berlin, Germany; CB Rank (Company): 297,174; Postal Code: 10787; Founded Date: 2016-09-01; Exit Date: 0; Full Description: The PropTech startup Simplifa offers real estate owners an all-round service in the area of elevator management with the help of smart building and Internet of Things technologies and already manages more than 1,000 elevator systems today. Elevators are a pain point for their owners: The operation and maintenance costs of the elevator generate some of the highest costs per square feet in the property and elevator downtimes cause extreme user dissatisfaction, high administrative burden for property managers and can even lead to justified rent reductions. Implementing operational obligations, such as maintenance, documentation and repair, lies in the primary responsibility of the property owners. However, due to high cost and often lack of expertise, this happens usually not only inefficiently, but also involves legal risks, for example due to failure to employ maintenance measures. In addition, there is a high information asymmetry between owner / property manager and elevator maintenance company, which often leads to disproportionately high maintenance costs. Simplifa structures, optimizes, and manages elevator portfolios for its customers. The startup serves as a central point of contact for owners and elevator service companies and acts as an expert on an equal footing in negotiations. Each elevator undergoes a technical inspection and is recorded in 360° shots to simulate a virtual “elevator twin”. In the event of system malfunctions, the maintenance company can ensure a much faster and more targeted repair thanks to the ""elevator twin"" without prior dispatch of a technician. Thanks to Simplifa, the operating and maintenance costs of the elevators are regularly reduced by about 30% while maintaining the same quality. In the future, the transmission of sensor data will provide a manufacturer-independent real-time analysis for a predictive maintenance system, which will reduce the manual test frequency of the elevators and avoid costly downtimes in advance.; Industry Groups: ['Real Estate']; Number of Founders: 2.0; Number of Employees: 75.5; Founders: Hubertus von Schierstaedt, Ludwig Busse; Number of Funding Rounds: 2; Last Funding Date: 2018-09-10; Top 5 Investors: PT1, BitStone Capital; Number of Lead Investors: 1.0; Number of Investors: 2.0; Announced Date Acquisition: 0; LinkedIn: Followers: OFFLINE; X: Followers: 167.0; X: Following: 217.0; X: Number of Tweets: 140.0; X: Account Age Days: 2395.0; X: Tweet Activity: 0.06; X: Followers Max Growth: 5.0; X: Followers Max Loss: -5.0; X: Tweets Max Growth: 12.0; X: Tweets Max Loss: -1.0; Months until First Round: 24.0; Last Round Type: Series A; Average Time To Next Round: 12.366666666666667; Average Number of Investments by Investors: 34.5; Average Number of Exits by Investors: 4.0; Average Number of Lead Investments by Investors: 15.0; Average Number of Portfolio Organizations by Investors: 25.5; LinkedIn: Average Followers Founders: 6084.5; LinkedIn: Average Connections Founders: 5980.0; LinkedIn: Min Followers Founders: 2264.0; LinkedIn: Max Followers Founders: 9905.0; LinkedIn: Min Connections Founders: 2260.0; LinkedIn: Max Connections Founders: 9700.0; Highest Education Doctor/PhD: 1.0; Highest Education Master: 1.0; Studies Abroad Founder: 0.5; Firsttime Founder Ratio: 0.5; Any Firsttime Founder: 1.0; Executive Ratio: 1.0; All Executives: 1.0; Any Executive: 1.0; Decade Experience Ratio: 1.0; Avg Gaps in Experience: 18.5; Avg Longest Position Duration: 176.55; Investor Country: .

The core technology that makes this possible is the polyPod. Edge computing, and the accompanying principle of decentralisation are the key aspects of the polyPod. These in combination make for a highly scaleable, secure and cost efficient model. For the internet of things to be sustainable we need solid foundations - the polyPod makes sure that data never needs to leave the Wearable, Smart-Watch, car or other IoT device that captures data in the first place. Thinking in this new paradigm allows developers to build features on top of the polyPod with the help of simple building blocks. Last but not least, this means a win-win for businesses too who can meaningfully reduce storage costs and eliminate those that have emerged as a result of GDPR - not to mention the risk of a data breach. At the same time higher quality data insights are generated - from customers who don't have to give up their data. That’s what a profitable data exchange looks like with a polyPod user.  The polyVerse, is the set of organisations behind polypoly. To empower the purpose-driven vision of inventing a new economic system for data, the polyVerse is comprised of three entities; The Foundation, The Enterprise and The Cooperative. All three entities serve a different function, yet are connected to ensure that the balance of interests combined goes into building a data economy that is efficient, privacy compliant and sustainable.  polypoly Enterprise is focused on economic interests and the requirements of the economy, polypoly Foundation focuses on Government requirements and a regulatory framework for the fair use of data. polypoly Cooperative is citizen focused and represents their interests, especially regarding wealth generated from their data. All three entities serve a different function yet the combination ensures that the balance never shifts in favour of one particular group's interests. All three entities keep each other in check to make sure the power balance is equally distributed. polypoly Enterprise: Creates solutions for entrepreneurs Successful digital business models are based on data. But Europe is losing its data capital to foreign mo- nopolies. European companies are currently dependent, gradually being deprived of access to business models that drive the digital economy. The solution: A decentralised data economy. polypoly Cooperative provides the technical basis – the polyPod. We develop tools and prod- ucts for an easy transition to a decen- tralised data economy. Entrepreneurs will be able to liberate themselves from data monopolies, therefore protecting their existing models and building new digital ones. polypoly Foundation: Understands the needs of public servants Europe is losing its data capital to foreign monopolies. As a result, European companies are cut off from their customers. Citizens data privacy is unprotected, and European states are losing taxpayers‘ money. We assist governments to build a decentralised data economy for Europe. The technical infrastructure is provided by a coop- erative of European citizens using the polyPod. The GDPR is baked into its code. The polyPod efficiently protects European citizens and frees European companies from dependence on data monopolies. It then follows that taxes on profits generated from European data capital are returned to Europe. polypoly Cooperative: Represents the interests of all citizens The core idea of every cooperative is achieving more together. Together we can reclaim sovereignty over our data! We are developing the technical basis for a decentralised data econ- omy: The polyPod, which belongs to all members of the Cooperative. The polyPod is available to all citizens enabling them to reclaim their data sovereignty. The polyPod stores user data on their personal end devices, which it never leaves. Citizens can choose how to make their data availa- ble, whether as a donation or for rent. If money is exchanged the cooperative receives a small percentage which is distributed to all cooperative members.; Industry Groups: ['Information Technology', 'Internet Services', 'Professional Services', 'Software']; Number of Founders: 1.0; Number of Employees: 30.5; Founders: Thorsten Dittmar; Number of Funding Rounds: 1; Last Funding Date: 2019-06-02; Top 5 Investors: 0; Announced Date Acquisition: 0; LinkedIn: Followers: 1786; X: Followers: 616.0; X: Following: 208.0; X: Number of Tweets: 485.0; X: Account Age Days: 1680.0; X: Tweet Activity: 0.29; X: Followers Max Growth: 3.0; X: Followers Max Loss: -16.0; X: Tweets Max Loss: -4.0; Months until First Round: -1.0; Last Round Type: No Funding; Average Time To Next Round: -1.0; International Team: 1.0; Investor Country: .

"Company Details: Organization Name: Enpal; Industries: ['Energy', 'Environmental Consulting', 'Renewable Energy', 'Solar']; Headquarters Location: Berlin, Berlin, Germany; CB Rank (Company): 16,485; Postal Code: 80 10245; Founded Date: 2017-02-01; Exit Date: 0; Full Description: Enpal is a Berlin-based company that provides all-in-one renewable energy solutions consisting of solar panels, battery, wallbox, heat pump and energy management system for customers across Germany and Italy.  Founding and early history Enpal was founded in 2017 by Mario Kohle, Jochen Ziervogel, and Viktor Wingert. The company received early backing from Lukasz Gadowski, the prominent entrepreneur and venture capitalist, and several board members of the Zalando fashion conglomerate. Enpal’s co-founders initially developed a sales-based business model, where end-users could purchase PV systems. Early market research suggested that a lease model would attract more uptake from customers who didn’t want the hassle of high investment costs and maintaining the solar system by themselves.  The company settled on a 20-year lease term, which proved wildly successful during the first few years of its existence. Its lease agreements require no upfront payment from the customer and include installation, insurance, maintenance and other services. Rapid growth and expansion For most of its history, Enpal focused on the German market, first around its hometown of Berlin and later throughout the whole country. During the late 2010s and early 2020s, the company opened several satellite offices in an effort to provide responsive, localized sales and service to customers across the country. In 2021, Enpal opened a state-of-the-art training center for solar PV installers, where it trains its rapidly growing team of craftsmen. The company now has more than 200 local installer teams, whose members make up the bulk of Enpal’s employee roster, and a robust, efficient supply chain. Enpal’s key backers have included major impact investors and climate-tech venture firms, including Princeville Climate Technologies, Softbank Vision Fund II, TPG Rise Climate, HV Capital, The Westly Group, and Activate Capital. Co-founder Mario Kohle remains a managing director of the company. Fellow co-founders Jochen Ziervogel and Viktor Wingert (the current Chief Investment Officer) remain deeply involved as well.  Enpal has won a number of awards over the years, including first place in the German Sustainability Prize Next Economy Award 2022, first place in the 2023 Smart Home Germany Awards, a 2023/2024 Stern Companies of the Future award, Die Welt #1 Service Champion in Customer Service Award, and KfW Award for Entrepreneurs 2022. The Enpal app was also awarded as Germany’s best solar management app. The company has also been among Germany’s fastest-growing companies in 2022 and 2023 based on the FT1000 ranking. Enpal today Today, Enpal has installed more than 60,000 solar PV systems across Germany and Italy. As of late 2022, Enpal is recognized as the market leader for solar PV installations in Germany. The company’s 2022 revenues exceeded 400 million euros on a headcount of more than 1,000 employees. After pivoting away from the sales model and focusing on leased systems for most of its history, Enpal added back a sales option in 2023 to accommodate customers who want to buy their solar solution.

The focus of our work is on developing conversational interfaces based on artificial intelligence that enable companies to automate customer communication. The Chatbot Solution called moinAI is a SaaS-Product developed by knowhere. moinAI is a self-learning AI chatbot solution for digital customer communication of companies. No matter if marketing, sales or customer service - moinAI is the automation solution that helps to react quickly and efficiently to customer requests around the clock. Depending on the use case, this results in benefits such as increased customer satisfaction, more automated leads, an increased conversion rate and a reduction in support volume.    Numerous companies from various industries have already optimized their customer communication with moinAI. These include Geberit, Velux, Abus, Der Spiegel and Dräger. The bandwidth of use cases ranges from first level support to marketing campaigns up to e-commerce strategies and many more. However, one thing is true for each of the above-mentioned use cases: the impressive KPIs resulting from automation.    What makes moinAI so special is its ability to learn on its own. The so-called self-learning works by means of several AI-principles and ensures that moinAI is a self-runner in the truest sense of the word. Once the AI chatbot has been trained by us and implemented at the respective company, no further and costly training sessions on the part of the company are required. In addition, the language understanding is Natural-Language-Processing-based (NLP-based), which means that the AI does not understand user queries on the basis of keywords, but instead identifies semantic relationships, which makes it possible to understand long and complicated sentences. Through NLP and AI, moinAI therefore understands even complex messages and learns independently with each user conversation. Thus moinAI offers a system that grows with the needs and requirements of the company.; Industry Groups: ['Artificial Intelligence (AI)', 'Data and Analytics', 'Information Technology', 'Internet Services', 'Messaging and Telecommunications', 'Sales and Marketing', 'Science and Engineering', 'Software']; Number of Founders: 5.0; Number of Employees: 30.5; Founders: Florian Nommensen, Markus Bröcker, Patrick Zimmermann, Robert Weber, Sebastian Schmitt; Number of Funding Rounds: 1; Last Funding Date: 2015-09-01; Top 5 Investors: SpinLab - The HHL Accelerator; Number of Investors: 1.0; Announced Date Acquisition: 0; LinkedIn: Followers: 2707; Months until First Round: -1.0; Last Round Type: No Funding; Average Time To Next Round: -1.0; LinkedIn: Average Followers Founders: 810.0; LinkedIn: Average Connections Founders: 742.0; LinkedIn: Min Followers Founders: 426.0; LinkedIn: Max Followers Founders: 1194.0; LinkedIn: Min Connections Founders: 384.0; LinkedIn: Max Connections Founders: 1100.0; Highest Education Master: 2.0; International Team: 1.0; Firsttime Founder Ratio: 1.0; All Firsttime Founders: 1.0; Any Firsttime Founder: 1.0; Researcher Ratio: 0.5; Any Researcher: 1.0; Executive Ratio: 0.5; Any Executive: 1.0; Decade Experience Ratio: 1.0; Avg Gaps in Experience: 3.0; Avg Longest Position Duration: 143.13333333333333; Investor Country: .

However, the way you plan collaboration is decisive for its productivity. Scedule is not the next scheduling tool. It's a SaaS platform that directs and governs scheduling processes for the benefit of a company’s business and productivity. Companies have numerous tools to manage data and processes. But they don't have any tool to manage and prioritise the organisation's time. When which group of participants works together on which topic is controlled exclusively by structural specifications. We are convinced that in a knowledge-driven economy, the use of time to create value must be digitised and automated. Therefor Scedule goes beyond the known scope of scheduling tools: A smart algorithm identifies meaningful date proposals that take into account specific business preferences. Resource bookings in linked groupware are made automatically and in advance according to the schedule. The Scedule API enables the integration of ready-to-use applications into company-specific collaboration tools.

Processes with SMEs in logistics are very time and cost intensive. The need for transparency and real-time status updates of shipments in the time critical express and courier market is very strong. Also 95% of car to van sized vehicles in this market are driving back empty after delivering a shipment, because those SMEs have only a small regional network that provides them with jobs and with the high pace in this time critical market, they can't organize backloads in time. An essential USP of CargoSteps is the cross company functionality with multiple parties of every size. Small companies usually have no system at all for their daily work and medium sized companies in this market have only isolated solutions that can't be used with their partners and subcontractors. With CargoSteps they can work with any company worldwide in less than 2 minutes. This opens completely new possibilities like the automated marketplace for backloads which you only have with slow and time uncritical general cargo shipments for big trucks with a minimum shipment size of one pallet. Everything below that gets ignored. CargoSteps on the other hand focuses on shipment sizes usually below a pallet but doesn't exclude any larger shipments. With CargoSteps' marketplace companies can improve their turnover about 50% while improving their service and freeing resources with the track & trace solution.; Industry Groups: ['Software', 'Transportation']; Number of Founders: 1.0; Number of Employees: 5.5; Founders: Murat Karakaya; Number of Funding Rounds: 4; Last Funding Date: 2017-03-05; Last Funding Amount: 12500.0; Total Funding Amount: 262500.0; Top 5 Investors: 0; Announced Date Acquisition: 0; LinkedIn: Followers: 583; X: Followers: 172.0; X: Following: 133.0; X: Number of Tweets: 511.0; X: Account Age Days: 3044.0; X: Tweet Activity: 0.17; X: Followers Max Growth: 1.0; X: Followers Max Loss: -1.0; X: Tweets Max Growth: 1.0; X: Tweets Max Loss: -1.0; Months until First Round: 26.0; Grant Y/N: 1.0; Last Round Type: Grant; Average Time To Next Round: 26.466666666666665; Average Funding Size: 12500.0; LinkedIn: Average Followers Founders: 3004.0; LinkedIn: Average Connections Founders: 2844.0; LinkedIn: Min Followers Founders: 3004.0; LinkedIn: Max Followers Founders: 3004.0; LinkedIn: Min Connections Founders: 2844.0; LinkedIn: Max Connections Founders: 2844.0; Highest Education Master: 1.0; International Team: 1.0; Firsttime Founder Ratio: 1.0; All Firsttime Founders: 1.0; Any Firsttime Founder: 1.0; Researcher Ratio: 1.0; All Researchers: 1.0; Any Researcher: 1.0; Executive Ratio: 1.0; All Executives: 1.0; Any Executive: 1.0; Decade Experience Ratio: 1.0; Avg Longest Position Duration: 133.93333333333334; Investor Country: .
