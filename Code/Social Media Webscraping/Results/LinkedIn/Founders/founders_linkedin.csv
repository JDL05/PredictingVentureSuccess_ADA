Its objective is to create successful and integrally sustainable (people, planet, profit) companies from the very beginning. AQAL Capital is using a standards-based, proprietary de-risking model and an investment philosophy called Integral Investing that was developed by Dr. Mariana Bozesan. In this investment style, high financial returns are inseparable from a high impact on Environmental and Social responsibility, ethical corporate Governance (ESG), as well as cultural aspects and happiness factors.
AQAL Capital is investing in Exponential-tech and Digital Evolution, Green-tech Evolution, and Life in the 21st Century. AQAL Capital invests in start-up companies based in the European Union with a focus in the DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) region. The technology of our investees must be proven and have a short runway to cash flow and break-even. According to our integral philosophy, the business models of our investees must be transferable to other countries, be scalable to market leadership, and deliver sustainable and risk-adjusted returns on all three axes: people, planet, and profit. In order to achieve these goals we also provide entrepreneurial and hands-on business as well as leadership support along the value chain to all our investees.

Our primary product is the SUPREME thruster; an Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic (AF-MPD) thruster incorporating HTS coils as a key enabling technology.
AF-MPD thrusters are a type of electric propulsion for spacecraft. All current spacecraft propulsion systems operate by expelling a reaction mass, which generates an opposing thrust force according to Newton’s 3rd Law of motion. There are two primary types of spacecraft propulsion: Chemical Propulsion, and Electric Propulsion. Unlike chemical systems, EP uses electrical energy to produce thrust, rather than the chemical energy stored in the fuel. As such, electric propulsion systems are only limited by the amount of power available, rather than the limited amount of energy contained in a unit amount of propellant. In other words, they are able to utilise fuel much more efficiently than chemical systems, resulting in lighter spacecraft and reduced costs.
Applications
The characteristics of the SUPREME thruster are best suited to missions with heavy payloads which require fast transfers using a highly efficient systems. Some examples of such missions:

Near-Earth:
•	Drag compensation of large structures (e.g. ISS)
•	Multi-use space vehicles for satellite servicing, satellite orbit raising, refuelling and debris removal.
•	Space Tourism
•	Space Manufacturing

Lunar:
•	Lunar Gateway Logistics

Human physical and mental faculties must be understood within the framework of a dissipative structure. The Dual Dissipation Theory (DDT) offers a consistent solution for the development of mental capabilities from single-cells, alliances of cells up to alliances of humans and related information-flows on each level.

The core statement of DDT: The structure-forming entity for mental faculties (consciousness, cognition, ...) is information, in addition to the structure-forming entity energy (matter), which creates the body in dissipation (metabolism). Thus every living being is to be understood as a dual dissipative structure. Its existence is based on flux. This holds both for the phylogenetic perspective and for the ontogenetic perspective.

The functional frame is adaptation, whether it is evolutionary adaptation or neuronal adaptation, which leads directly to support the concept of predictive processing. On this basis, it is possible to explain the genesis of different types of consciousness, which emerge especially in humans, like time consciousness and ego- or I-consciousness. This results in a theory of the system brain, as part of the human system, as part of a social system (culture). Any living system can only be fully understood by taking into account interactions with its environment throughout its history.",Co-Founder ,harisch ventures,Jan. 2021–Heute · 4 Jahre 1 Monat,"München, Bayern, Deutschland",,GF,KAHA GmbH,2012–Dez. 2015 · 4 Jahre,"Lahr, München und Umgebung, Deutschland","M&A, Marketing, Markenaufbau, Branding, Technologieberatung",CEO,GoYellow Media AG,Jan. 2009–Jan. 2011 · 2 Jahre 1 Monat,München,"Co-Founder and CEO, Strategic Sale, Size 40 Mio. €",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To do so successfully, it is important to fully understand company needs by working closely with each client. This helps value their work, recognize a common goal and express the full potential of the company. My tasks range between generating new ideas and improving or revising existing ones. Freelancing has given me the chance to offer my knowledge and express my creativity, from brand ideation to product realization - usually in the Luxury and Fashion world.

Brand Ideation - Strong brand identity and a clear creative strategy is necessary to lead the way to a bold DNA within the brand. My work consists in assisting clients on the creative direction of their company, both online and offline.

Product Realization - I specialize in fashion accessories, such as: footwear, leather-goods and eyewear. I am able to take care of the entire creative process, from start to end: research, design, style detailing and factory management from prototyping to production - including factory sourcing in Italy, if requested by the client.

Production - Thanks to some trustworthy relationships established with various structures around Italy, I am able to provide clients with excellent suppliers and qualified factories that work to satisfy company needs and respect budget limitations. ‘Made in Italy’ is usually associated only to the luxury world, but I believe the term actually stands for: experience, quality and attention to detail - qualities that each company should strive for. 

I believe that successful products can be led by a solid brand DNA. My mission is to be able to create a ‘fil rouge’ that connects all the dots in a company, offering an ‘independant eye’, combined to qualified experience and the ability to work for complex organizations.

In 2017 the company was acquired by a fund called Armònia SGR, who’s mission is to expand the business economically through a general brand relaunch of its image, product and distribution. One of the company’s requirements for Aspesi’s rebranding was to expand the product categories by adding a freshly designed accessories line to the brand’s namesake clothing collection. My role, as a Creative Consultant of the Accessories Line, is to be responsible for Aspesi’s first in-house Bags & SLG’s Collection, taking care of all aspects, from design to production.  

I focused on designing a new accessories line that could represent Aspesi’s sophisticated, minimal, ’no-logo’ design. I tried to replicate the casual yet functional and refined aesthetic of the clothing line, by creating classical, everyday designs, characterized by the use of exclusive and avant-garde fabrics, sourced in Japan and Italy. The first collection designed for men and women (S/S19) was entirely made in nylon. Production was assigned to a team of experienced Italian artisans, in the area of Lombardia, which I manage and direct from start to completion. These technicians were essential in the experimental phase of the collection - they helped me play with the different nylons, in order to understand the material properties. Every style is manufactured differently depending on it’s design, functionality or customer use - the padding and material combinations are the fruit of careful product research. The second collection focuses more on the use of authentic Italian leathers and classical designs. Even if production is entirely Made in Italy, all styles are designed and classified as ‘price sensitive’ - special attention has been put into positioning strategically these styles into today's market, by classifying the collection as affordable fashion.",Creative Director and Co-Founder,aeyde GmbH,Jan. 2016–Apr. 2017 · 1 Jahr 4 Monate,"Berlin Area, Germany","aeyde GmbH is a project I started working on during my last year in New York. I met the brand’s two founders when aeyde was still in a conceptual phase but after an initial debriefing of ideas, we immediately started collaborating. The aim of the project was to create an online-first shoe brand that could offer quality footwear at an affordable price. To show my support, I decided to take a risk and design their first two collections with no real guarantee. Due to my full-time job at Camuto, I dedicated evenings and spare time to designing aeyde’s first footwear collections, and in Sept. 2015 the brand’s first-ever styles were launched on the market. I was offered the official Co-Founder and Creative Director role in Jan 2016, after deciding to move to Berlin. As the only creative figure at the time, my responsibilities involved the whole creative process: head-to-toe product design, including factory management and production, but also a complete overview of the brand’s identity. Having one vision throughout the whole creative process strengthened the brand signature in a consistent way, allowing me to contribute to the brand’s success by delivering the brand’s first five official collections (from A/W15 to A/W17) and by creating aeyde's iconic styles and 'best-sellers', that ensure ongoing seasonal sales and a solid base for the brand to build on in future.

We operate Monto dos Dados - an applied research farm in Alentejo, Portugal -  where we work on the intersection of farming, IoT, Web3 & AI. Our purpose is to investigate the tokenization of agricultural assets & sustainable ecosystem services such as soil quality, water retention, biodiversity mainanace, or CO2 sequestration using hardware wallets and sensor technology. Our main question is how one can use data driven farming practices and tokenization to generate publicly verifiable sustainability-proofs that can provide additional revenue streams for farmer - such as the sale of tokenized CO2 certificates.

Token Kitchen regularly publishes on topics of tokenization, Web3 & blockchain networks with the aim to educate a non-tech audience about the socio-economic potentials (and threats) of the Web3 and its applications.

THIRD EDITION:
When writing the first and second edition of TOKEN ECONOMY, the focus was to get the scope of all related topics right. In the third edition I realized that needed not only to sharpen the scope but also go much deeper into each single chapter than I had done in the two previous editions. As a result, the word-count of the book grew so much that I decided to divide the book into three volumes:
- Token Economy: Money, NFTs & DeFi: https://amzn.to/3otwZSf
- Token Economy: DAOs & Purpose-Driven Tokens: https://amzn.to/49qGV1m
- Token Economy: Web3 Infrastructure  (Release date: 2024)

SECOND EDITION
For all those who want to read a primer to Web3 infrastructure & applications, the second edition is still available, since it contains chapters that will be updated it the two upcoming books of the third edition. Once all three volumes of the third edition have been released, the second edition will not be available for sale anymore.

What started as a Berlin-based Info:Hub Thinking:Hub and People:Hub panned out into different local hubs across Europe. In 2016 the idea of BlockchainHub expanded into different territories. The vision was to educate about the Web3, tokens, blockchain and smart contracts to all stakeholders in society, explaining the technology, showcase use cases, organize events and host working groups around interdisciplinary topics. In 2018 most local hubs pivoted their activities either into building their own blockchain networks (Graz) or joining bigger communities (Brussels) or going into the industry.BlockchainHub Berlin also reduced the activities when the Cryptoeconomics Institute at the Vienna University of Economics was founded and Shermin Voshmgir and Valentin Kalinov started working there.

In the modern world every industry is a software industry. ""Software is eating the world"". Software is critical to solving some of the trickiest problems today, pushing beyond existing boundaries in transportation, energy, manufacturing of goods, food production, and other areas.
 
Current software programs are represented as just textual code, disconnected from the problem,domain and data. The program is primarily encoded for the machine, not for humans. The programmer must provide all the answers, up-front; precisely specified. This approach does not help to understand the problem at hand, or even the particular solution chosen.
 
We solve this through Flow-Based Programming, a programming paradigm where software is defined through ""black boxes"" that communicate via information packets sent over connections that users can define visually.
 
The Flowhub IDE was first developed as a better programming tool for our own use. It was announced as the ""NoFlo Development Environment"" crowdfunding campaign in 2013. It became the 5th highest funded software Kickstarter at the time, confirming the demand for our solution in the wider software developer community.

- Trapped in the „next feature fallacy“ far too often (thanks for helping us out @Andrew Chen)
- Launched a service without having decent analytics in place (because of speed) having no means of navigation through the foggy sea of finding product market fit

This is the reality Catalisa brings to life through our pioneering low/no-code technology.

At the heart of Catalisa lies a powerful concept: composability. Much like constructing with LEGO blocks, this feature allows banks to swiftly integrate new features or services. It's a game-changer, enabling financial institutions to respond to market demands and customer needs with agility never seen before.

Imagine Catalisa as a vast LEGO set designed explicitly for the banking sector. Each block, a potential service or feature, waiting to be snapped together in creative and innovative ways.

This modular approach not only simplifies the development of complex banking solutions but also opens the door to a world brimming with innovation potential.

I played a key role in driving the bank's growth and success through effective executive management, strategic planning, and financial management. In the Retail segment, I was responsible for managing a team of 400 people and overseeing the development and implementation of products and services for end-users, such as loans, insurance, and vehicle financing.

This strategy was synchronized with various areas of the bank, including businesses, finance, credit and new businesses.

In the Innovation and Special Projects area, we successfully implemented a structuring initiative by applying the platformization model, which allowed us to break our traditional ""linear chains"" into a ""non-linear"" approach, focusing on the product value chain and breaking it down into a scalable and reliable platform that allows the bank to quickly and integrally build new and more products, cost-efficient and customer-focused.

First, I extended the novel motion anchoring paradigm proposed in my PhD to encode high density camera array (HDCA) imagery, which yields state-of-the-art compression performance (paper published in IEEE Transations of Image Processing).
Second, I proposed HEVC-EPIC, which leverages coded motion vectors to obtain a fast, high quality optical flow estimator, which was also published in IEEE TIP. 
Both these works have resulted in patent applications.

Tools in use: C++, Matlab",PhD in Electrical Engineering,UNSW,März 2013–Sept. 2016 · 3 Jahre 7 Monate,Sydney,"In my PhD, I explored new motion anchoring strategies for highly scalable video compression, which represent a fundamental change to the way motion is employed – from a “prediction-centric” point of view to a “physical” representation of the underlying motion of the scene. The proposed “reference-based” motion anchorings can support computationally efficient, high quality temporal motion inference, which requires as few as half of the coded motion fields compared to conventional codecs. This novel motion anchoring paradigm is well-adapted to seamlessly supporting “features” beyond compressibility, including high scalability, accessibility, and “intrinsic” frame upsampling. These features are becoming ever more relevant as the way video is consumed continues shifting from the traditional broadcast scenario with predefined network and decoder constraints to interactive browsing of video content over heterogeneous networks.

Our work combines creativity with shrewd expertise to ensure each project has purpose. Our productions help drive the booming Experience Economy throughout luxury retail, hospitality, the built environment and the public realm.

Previous work includes productions for Manolo Blahnik, Finlandia Vodka, Bang & Olufsen, Whirlpool and Macallan, as well as initiatives such as the world’s first pop-up avocado restaurant and Nordic Yulefest. For Meredith, every project requires a precise blend of the structure to succeed, with the curiosity to create.",Founder - Director,Meredith Collective,Jan. 2012–Mai 2015 · 3 Jahre 5 Monate,London,"In 2012  Meredith founded Meredith Bespoke, an award winning events company dealing with a diverse cross section of global luxury brands including Vivienne Westwood, Manolo Blahnik, Lulu Guinness, Lamborghini and iconic establishments such as Burlington Arcade.

The company’s first self-branded public consumer venture Ohlala Macarons,, was documented in The Wall Street Journal, Marie Claire and ELLE, amongst others, and profiled on Sir Alan Sugar’s “The Apprentice”.

Building on this success Meredith Bespoke combined their knowledge of the needs of luxury brands with their ability to engage the consumer market to launch their 21-day Christmas pop-up Nordic Yulefest in December 2014 followed by a one night spectacular Broken Hearts & Promises in February 2015. Both pop-ups focused on their self-coined concept of ‘New Luxury’ – exceptional quality in ephemeral spaces. The success of these events, along with the company’s ever expanding public persona and the growing direction of brand enhancement led to Meredith re-branding Meredith Bespoke to Meredith Collective; creating an umbrella platform to operate from that ensured the continuity of quality and client commitment that all her individual endeavours entailed.

Add around 6 to 8 weeks for drafting the AS IS and TO BE processes with the MT, and I realized an enormous improvement of the company in less than 6 months (without frustrating or leaving demotivated employees behind).

So waren unsere Entwickler bestens auf immer komplexere Herausforderungen vorbereitet.

Mein Fokus lag stets auf nachhaltigem Wachstum, Teamentwicklung und langfristigem Erfolg. Die Strategie war, das Team durchdacht zu skalieren und eine multifunktionale Struktur aufzubauen, die unser Wachstum effektiv unterstützt. Zusammen mit meinem Team schuf ich ein Umfeld, das kontinuierliches Lernen fördert, da Anpassungsfähigkeit und Verbesserung entscheidend für den Erfolg sind.

Ich war weiterhin eng in den Entwicklungsprozess eingebunden, mit einem praxisnahen Ansatz bei Architektur, Einführung neuer Technologien und Betreuung von Nachwuchsingenieuren.

- Schaffung wichtiger technischer Grundlagen für die Skalierung von Solytic nach der Eingliederung von Powerdoo.

Als Co-Gründer und CTO der Powerdoo GmbH war es mein primäres Ziel, eine frühe Prototyp-Lösung von Grund auf neu zu entwickeln. Als Leiter eines kleinen, aber agilen Teams von drei Entwicklern konzentrierten wir uns auf schnelles Prototyping und die schnelle Bereitstellung von Funktionen, um sicherzustellen, dass wir schnell auf Marktanforderungen und Kundenfeedback reagieren können. Ich war für den Entwurf und die Implementierung der zentralen Geschäftslogik und der technischen Lösung verantwortlich und kombinierte das Verständnis der Kundenanforderungen mit den technischen Erkenntnissen, die für die Entwicklung eines skalierbaren Produkts erforderlich sind.

Eine der wichtigsten Umstellungen war der Wechsel von einem benutzerdefinierten Client-Server-Ansatz zu einer modernen SaaS-Webanwendung auf Cloud-Basis. Diese Umstellung ermöglichte nicht nur eine größere Flexibilität und Skalierbarkeit, sondern legte auch den Grundstein für das, was später ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Solytic-Software werden sollte. Die schnelle Weiterentwicklung des Produkts ermöglichte es uns, eine hochmoderne Plattform bereitzustellen, die den wachsenden Anforderungen des Marktes für erneuerbare Energien gerecht wurde und hunderte Endkunden erreichte.

Vision: global B2B food exchange, to eliminate food waste in the supply chain and drive down climate damage as a result. Picture success: how fantastic would it be, to achieve these goals!

Mission: efficient match-making of food supply and food surplus with demand, using an AI-driven distribution platform. Europe as a starting point. Roll-out: international.  

Rationale & time to act: worldwide, 2.5 billion tons of food are wasted every year, 12-18 million tons in Germany alone. At the same time, 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food waste. Hence, two major reasons, to make the global food supply chain more efficient. Targeted outcome: real-time and predictive match-making of supply and demand, to avoid 30-40% of food overproduction - and to protect resources and climate. 

Thrilled about SPRK's global first place at XTC Extreme Tech Challenge (smart cities) in 2020. SPRK was recently nominated for Germany’s federal digitalization award  by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL).

STOMT simplifies and channels customer feedback across all your touchpoints, enrich it with environmental data and utilizes AI to help you manage it and enable you to establish a feedback culture with your customers. 

WHY IT MATTERS:
Customer relationships are becoming more and more important. As businesses grow, the dialog with your customers and, in turn, customer relationships are suffering. In other words, customer relationships don’t scale. An even bigger problem is that only 4% of all customers provide feedback at all while 96% gets lost. Therefore 55% of all associated complaints end up circulating on social media channels. Thus, there is a lack of dialogue as well as a simultaneous lack of control over the dissemination and circulation of feedback.

We all possess incredible concepts with the potential to evolve into successful businesses or meaningful projects. (... here it comes)

BUT most of us feel hesitant, blocked or afraid to share those ideas.

The first step is the most challenging; it takes courage to articulate your thoughts and transform your idea into reality. It can be so overwhelming as it exposes your vision to the ‘dangers' of judgment, criticism or even mockery. (speaking out of experience here)

I offer you a safe space and nurturing environment for you to explore and develop your dreams and ideas. I am here to listen with an open mind and heart, and to offer guidance and support whenever you seek it. No matter what was dormant in your little idea-seedling, what truly matters is responding to that inner calling and starting to pursue the dreams you’ve set aside for too long.

In our confidential conversations, I will guide you through your creative journey, acting as a midwife to your ideas. Everyone is unique and therefore we all need different stimulation, inspiration and methods to work with. I will share a variety of techniques from my repertoire in business and personal growth to help you plant and nurture your personal and precious idea-seed.

That means not just offering greener ways to get from A to B but also setting a high bar for others to follow, from pioneering sustainable swappable batteries and integrated helmets to being the first in the sector to go fully climate-neutral. 

Now Europe’s leading player in its field, TIER’s electric scooters, bikes and mopeds are enjoyed in over 130 cities, from London and Paris to Berlin and Dubai - and we’re just getting started. By adding greener travel to the transport mix and reimagining the possibilities of sustainable business, climate-neutral TIER is committed to a zero-emission future. We’ve made game-changing progress so far, yet still remain at the early stages of our hugely exciting journey.

When it comes to food quality and freshness, we are used to rely on the best before date, believing that food that lasts longer should be fresher. But technically the best before date has no direct connection with product freshness, it only states the end of the producer’s liability; nothing more, nothing less. 
To provide food retailers a better insight into the quality and freshness of their product, tsenso offers the FreshCloud: a secure and confidential storage solution for on food data for all players along the food supply chain. The cloud analytics build the link between the logistic events and the quality assurance action and make the hidden quality costs of the supply chain visible. One of our KPI, the FreshIndex asses the microbiological spoilage of food based on true measured data and gives quantitative insight into food quality and freshness, down to the individual product unit.  The FreshIndex can prove to consumers in an intuitive way that a given product is of excellent quality and for how long it will really last. Currently the FreshIndex is limited to meat and fish product. An extension to fruits and vegetagles is in examination. 
By giving QA responsibles a easy to understand tool for freshness assessment, they can focus their work on the important issues. We believe that the FreshIndex can significantly reduce food waste within the industry and on the longer run also in consumer households.

Together we started building up the vision and the prototypes of a mountable electric drive system that converts any existing skateboard into an electric vehicle for last mile transportation.

We officially founded the Mellow Boards GmbH in February 2015 to make our dream a reality.
A Kickstarter campaign held in Mai 2015 brought the initial funding of roughly 310k€ (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1800147378/mellow-the-electric-drive-that-fits-under-every-sk?lang=de)

Having gained much needed funding and confidence in the concept, we took off on our exciting journey.
We build up a fantastic team, network of partners and suppliers as well as a production line here in Germany.
Several investors where found supplying us with over 5M€ in funding, thus enabling us to hit the international market in early 2017.

""A substantial share of future revenues for car manufacturers will result from customer access and interaction in cars and benefit those companies who own this access. HAVIKs technology can enable car OEMs to generate substantial added revenue by distributing their targetable in-car inventory (audio- and audiovisual channel of the head unit) as a service to 3rd party content partners just like other digital services do. 
Car manufactures will be enabled to do their own platform economics and commercially provide their customers with extensive user-centered infotainment and services for an enriched driving experience."" - HAVIK, 2015

We brought this product to MVP stage together with a.o. Car2Go, with great support of their leadership. Utilising their platform that already had a big customer base at that time and could tell who was using their vehicles when and where, would have been a pretty straight forward PoC for added in-car revenue in car-sharing through HAVIK. Daimler/Renault though, who's Headunit we were dependent on, worked with and utilised Software in a totally different way than us (or other Tech-Companies) and Software freezes that laid 2 years back at that time already brought HAVIK's development close to a halt.

Other opportunities opened up through this collaboration though and we were made aware of other, for OEMs more urgent issues in getting help building mobility services.

At this point I met Patrick and we joint forces on his Corporate Venture Builder idea to help others building up mobility services with the help of our talent and technology.

Durch die Nutzung von End-of-Life-PET aus Abfallbehandlungsanlagen und Polyestertextilien aus etablierten Sammelplattformen, streben sie eine nachhaltigere Verwendung von Plastik an.
