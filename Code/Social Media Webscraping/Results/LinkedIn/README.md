# LinkedIn Resulting CSVs Information
Resulting CSV files include linkedIn company IDs, followers, employeeCount (amount of associated employees with a linkedIn profile) and
range of approximated employees (set by each company independently)

Additionally there is an error column. That one is usually filled if the page is broken.

Similarly the entries which include "OFFLINE" in the variable columns have a pulled LinkedIn Page.
