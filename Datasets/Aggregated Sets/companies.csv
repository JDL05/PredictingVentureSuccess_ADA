An owner of a canteen needs to know the right meals, number of dishes and guests. The right combination is complex. The result is overstocking and overproduction, which means higher food cost for the canteen. On average 1 of the 44.000 German canteens loses 50k € every year.  With Mitakus we develop a software to help owners to reduce food cost, by providing them a demand forecast, which is integrated into systems that they are already using.  Essentially, you can imagine our solution as a web browser plugin, only that we build a plugin into cash registers and planning software.

Processes with SMEs in logistics are very time and cost intensive. The need for transparency and real-time status updates of shipments in the time critical express and courier market is very strong. Also 95% of car to van sized vehicles in this market are driving back empty after delivering a shipment, because those SMEs have only a small regional network that provides them with jobs and with the high pace in this time critical market, they can't organize backloads in time. An essential USP of CargoSteps is the cross company functionality with multiple parties of every size. Small companies usually have no system at all for their daily work and medium sized companies in this market have only isolated solutions that can't be used with their partners and subcontractors. With CargoSteps they can work with any company worldwide in less than 2 minutes. This opens completely new possibilities like the automated marketplace for backloads which you only have with slow and time uncritical general cargo shipments for big trucks with a minimum shipment size of one pallet. Everything below that gets ignored. CargoSteps on the other hand focuses on shipment sizes usually below a pallet but doesn't exclude any larger shipments. With CargoSteps' marketplace companies can improve their turnover about 50% while improving their service and freeing resources with the track & trace solution.","['Software', 'Transportation']",1.0,5.5,Murat Karakaya,4,2017-03-05,12500.0,Grant,290915.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0,583,3,2-10,2,10

It has amazing performance, it’s intuitive and it’s future-proof. Tamio is designed to give you peace of mind, at the speed of light. Plugin-free. Maintenance-free. Hassle-free. Mission & Vision Our mission is to end the pain of e-commerce and empower entrepreneurs, merchants and agencies to do the work that matters. Our vision is a world of e-commerce without limitations – a place where anyone can realize their dreams and economic opportunities. Our Promise: Peace of mind. At the speed of light. Tamio eCom+ lets you focus on the work that matters. No hassle, no maintenance, no locked features. An ecom platform that just works. Founded: 2016 Payments Processed: +15M Eur Users on previous eCom solutions: +4000 Our story: End the pain of e-commerce While the struggles of running a business are real, there's really no reason any longer to add to the challenge with tricky e-commerce platforms. As web and e-commerce developers we grew tired of spending more time on troubleshooting and patching old systems, than on helping our clients improve and grow their business. Crushing Complexity Most well-known e-commerce platforms have been around for more than 15 years. And the level of complexity is overwhelming. Plugins that cause all sorts of problems and slow your site down. Maintenance and updates take valuable time. Restrictions that limit your opportunities to grow. We could say a thousand more things. But this is not a wall of complaints. This is the story of what we did about it. Peace of mind. At the speed of light It started with the belief that there had to be a better way. So we stopped complaining and set out to build something new and better. We had three demands on the e-commerce platform we wanted to develop. It had to be easier to use than the alternatives, it had to be lightning-fast, and it should not cause any trouble – in other words, it should just work. In essence: Working with e-commerce, we wanted to feel peace of mind, at the speed of light. And that is how our customer promise came to be. What makes us different? To deliver on the promise – peace of mind, at the speed of light – we needed to clear three big obstacles. Plugins cause more problems than they solve, so they had to go. Writing our own code would give us complete control – and full responsibility. We would have skin in the game. Maintenance can’t be the user’s concern. We keep the platform updated, stable, secure, and fast. So that you can focus on your customers and core business. Restrictions like locked features hold you back, and complex pricing plans make it almost impossible to know the cost. Tamio eCom+ has one fair price and no locked features. Focus on work that matters As an e-commerce merchant you want to take care of your customers, not bugs. You want to improve your products and services, not wasting time on troubleshooting. If you value simplicity and speed, we believe you will love Tamio eCom+ for just how simple it is to use, and for how fast it is – both at getting things done, and how fast it loads your eStore. Happy e-commerce adventures!

As an initial component of the AssistMe care platform, alea enables a contemporary, efficient care data culture for future intersectoral, networked processes and digitally supported teamwork. In the end, the aim is to effectively support care in times of a shortage of skilled workers through more self-determined content transparency - with complete personal autonomy and freedom of action and less redundancy & stress. Elderly Care will struggle in the next 10 years due to an increasing ageing population, fewer caregivers, more workload, stress, and manual documentation. All of that is a problem for the well-being of those in need of care. Furthermore, the incontinence management means large time and material expenses for caregivers. With the joint system, both companies can equip over 80 % of care recipients in care homes. An initial scientific study proved that the system could save 23 % of adult diapers and time while changing them. Together with significantly fewer leakages, the caregiver can reinvest the time gained in even higher quality care work. This ultimately has the potential to benefit care recipients in terms of quality of sleep and life.  Digital functions for optimized care processes   With a very new smart sensor strip, we made leading quality adult diaper brands compatible with the digital possibilities of intelligent care technology of alea. The system reveals where care needs exist, but are not immediately visible, e.g. the urine status in the adult diaper which previously was not known until manually checked. The system transforms this initially hidden care and health data and converts it into digital, structured, immediately understandable real-time information for elderly care and its relevant stakeholders. All functionalities are based on the device alea sensor clip on smart Diaper products, which can be attached and changed in seconds. With just one quick click, caregivers turn the smart diaper into a ready-to-use digital care assistance system. With an optimal sensor position in the centre of the adult diaper and without direct skin contact. The alea hardware can generate highly valid information and make it available to care staff in real time through the mobile and web apps. The care-relevant information of alea includes the amount of urine, movements in the care bed for effective pressure ulcer prevention, fall detection and zone management.  How caregivers, care homes & care recipients benefit   Over 80 % of care home residents suffer from incontinence. This is a major challenge for everyone involved. The smart system solves issues for all care related audiences: Care recipients benefit from less time in full incontinence pads, but also benefit from fewer manual visual checks during bedtimes. In addition, there is a higher level of safety and prevention. By reducing time-consuming routine and visual checks on an as-needed basis. Caregivers can invest the time gained in other important or relevant care tasks. In this way, they can increase their self-determination in their work and thus their job satisfaction. Thanks to the significant savings in materials and costs, care home operators gain more planning security and can focus their business value creation even better on direct care for people in need of care. In this way, care homes can position themselves as more attractive employers for care staff because they have state-of-the-art digital equipment. With the Care. For the Care.    The solution was developed and tested together with the care practice. With the IoT and future-proof platform approach, caregivers will benefit from additional functions in an established and accepted product setting. The system can be connected to various care documentation systems via open interfaces. The aim of the solution is not only to reduce the workload for all those involved in care. Care homes can also optimize teamwork and automate routine processes to support caregivers in the interests of people-centric care in the face of an increasing shortage of skilled staff. With the market entry, care homes can obtain information and order from us or one of our partners. While they order smart Diapers from our partners in the unit price context they are used to, alea Digital System comes as a software-as-a-service model. Without any additional initial costs, they can use all functions via personally provided hardware and software for each care recipient – for the most cost-efficient and needs-orientated use.","['Health Care', 'Internet Services', 'Software']",2.0,30.5,"Jens Grudno, Julio Brandl",5,2019-10-08,2000000.0,Series A,5681542.0,Sunhope Capital,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,0,1522,27,11-50,11,50

BEAD analysis learns from the building and its users and is empowered to start taking over the most intelligent operation of the building. The building will not only be a smart building but also a building operated by artificial intelligence based on ever-improving, anonymised data. It controls automation and redirects energy to be used where and when it is needed. Its logic builds on the idea that buildings are dynamic entities and should be treated more like living and learning organisms and not like static dumb assets. Today, they give the opportunity to commercial buildings owners who don't know how they consume energy to connect with the buildings life cycle in order to save energy and cost while getting the same level of quality as up to now via operating the buildings with BEADs' AI.

Simply and quickly connect your store with CoolBeez, and your customers will receive emails with links leading to your store.

Videos have been regarded as proof that something has happened; however, today anyone can swap faces of politicians or other people just by following a step-by-step guide available online.

Founding and early history Enpal was founded in 2017 by Mario Kohle, Jochen Ziervogel, and Viktor Wingert. The company received early backing from Lukasz Gadowski, the prominent entrepreneur and venture capitalist, and several board members of the Zalando fashion conglomerate. Enpal’s co-founders initially developed a sales-based business model, where end-users could purchase PV systems. Early market research suggested that a lease model would attract more uptake from customers who didn’t want the hassle of high investment costs and maintaining the solar system by themselves.  The company settled on a 20-year lease term, which proved wildly successful during the first few years of its existence. Its lease agreements require no upfront payment from the customer and include installation, insurance, maintenance and other services. Rapid growth and expansion For most of its history, Enpal focused on the German market, first around its hometown of Berlin and later throughout the whole country. During the late 2010s and early 2020s, the company opened several satellite offices in an effort to provide responsive, localized sales and service to customers across the country. In 2021, Enpal opened a state-of-the-art training center for solar PV installers, where it trains its rapidly growing team of craftsmen. The company now has more than 200 local installer teams, whose members make up the bulk of Enpal’s employee roster, and a robust, efficient supply chain. Enpal’s key backers have included major impact investors and climate-tech venture firms, including Princeville Climate Technologies, Softbank Vision Fund II, TPG Rise Climate, HV Capital, The Westly Group, and Activate Capital. Co-founder Mario Kohle remains a managing director of the company. Fellow co-founders Jochen Ziervogel and Viktor Wingert (the current Chief Investment Officer) remain deeply involved as well.  Enpal has won a number of awards over the years, including first place in the German Sustainability Prize Next Economy Award 2022, first place in the 2023 Smart Home Germany Awards, a 2023/2024 Stern Companies of the Future award, Die Welt #1 Service Champion in Customer Service Award, and KfW Award for Entrepreneurs 2022. The Enpal app was also awarded as Germany’s best solar management app. The company has also been among Germany’s fastest-growing companies in 2022 and 2023 based on the FT1000 ranking. Enpal today Today, Enpal has installed more than 60,000 solar PV systems across Germany and Italy. As of late 2022, Enpal is recognized as the market leader for solar PV installations in Germany. The company’s 2022 revenues exceeded 400 million euros on a headcount of more than 1,000 employees. After pivoting away from the sales model and focusing on leased systems for most of its history, Enpal added back a sales option in 2023 to accommodate customers who want to buy their solar solution. Either model can save the customer tens of thousands of euros over the course of a system’s 20- to 25-year useful lifespan, according to company data. Enpal has also diversified its product offerings in recent years. It now offers all-in-one renewable energy solutions consisting of solar panels, battery, wallbox, heat pump and energy management system.","['Energy', 'Natural Resources', 'Professional Services', 'Sustainability']",3.0,3000.5,"Jochen Ziervogel, Mario Kohle, Viktor Wingert",16,2024-11-14,100000000.0,Debt Financing,3693879999.0,"European Investment Bank, TPG, BlackRock, UniCredit, Bank of America",14.0,40.0,0.0,,,,0,103313,2817,1001-5000,1001,5000

The widespread adoption of cloud native technologies such as containers and Kubernetes has made it easier than ever to operate and scale applications. But important developer workflows have been overlooked or neglected along the way. Many developers find that they’re now less productive than they were before the cloud native era. Testing is a critical part of the development process and one that’s in need of a major upgrade. Modern cloud native testing practices are largely driven by what’s feasible rather than what’s useful. Developers working on distributed microservices applications have been left without an efficient way to build, run tests, and troubleshoot in a production-like environment. Garden makes it easy to spin up ephemeral testing and preview environments for integration tests, manual QA, and development. With Garden, developers get fast feedback exactly when they need it, and DevOps teams are no longer bogged down with provisioning and managing ad hoc environments.

It is an easy appointment booking platform for pet owners to book verified mobile vets who will visit your home.  Why are we so passionate about this ? We understand how terrifying it can be for your pets to visit a Veterinary. Plus there are always these fear of whether the Vet is competent enough, whether the people at the clinic are friendly enough, whether the problem your pet is facing can be easily diagnosed, whether you will have to hop around and visit different Vets for the same problem you are facing. Then there is the question of time. No-one likes to travel all the way to the vet clinic and then wait for hours to finally get the Vet’s attention. With HUG A PET, you book fixed appointment, the consultation is as long as your pet needs it in the comfort of your home or office and your pet gets a personalized attention. We are disrupting the current pet healthcare quality and bringing comfort, personalized experience and superior quality to the pet owners.    Our Mission: Our mission for HUG A PET is simple : to attract, nurture and grow the world's best mobile health care providers for pets via our platform and compliment that with exceptional customer service. We are working hard to create a technology where we can support the Veterinarians to reach the pet owners faster, provide them with updated pet's medical and psychological history on their mobile device, and act as an operational ninja that constantly collaborates with latest status between the pet owner and the vet on-the-go.

The use of modular and scalable wind energy systems based on the Lego Principle offers every customer flexible and efficient wind energy.   Thanks to the latest high-tech technology, our wind systems are efficient, flexible and scalable due to the innovation of modularity.

The solution is to reward environmentally-friendly activities, especially by industry and businesses, and to make climate-damaging practices more expensive.   Renewable energy generation for personal use is an important driver of the Green Tech megatrends or Smart Energy​ because the energy generated is easy to install and maintain on the one hand and on the other hand inexpensive and flexible.

The core technology that makes this possible is the polyPod. Edge computing, and the accompanying principle of decentralisation are the key aspects of the polyPod. These in combination make for a highly scaleable, secure and cost efficient model. For the internet of things to be sustainable we need solid foundations - the polyPod makes sure that data never needs to leave the Wearable, Smart-Watch, car or other IoT device that captures data in the first place. Thinking in this new paradigm allows developers to build features on top of the polyPod with the help of simple building blocks. Last but not least, this means a win-win for businesses too who can meaningfully reduce storage costs and eliminate those that have emerged as a result of GDPR - not to mention the risk of a data breach. At the same time higher quality data insights are generated - from customers who don't have to give up their data. That’s what a profitable data exchange looks like with a polyPod user.  The polyVerse, is the set of organisations behind polypoly. To empower the purpose-driven vision of inventing a new economic system for data, the polyVerse is comprised of three entities; The Foundation, The Enterprise and The Cooperative. All three entities serve a different function, yet are connected to ensure that the balance of interests combined goes into building a data economy that is efficient, privacy compliant and sustainable.  polypoly Enterprise is focused on economic interests and the requirements of the economy, polypoly Foundation focuses on Government requirements and a regulatory framework for the fair use of data. polypoly Cooperative is citizen focused and represents their interests, especially regarding wealth generated from their data. All three entities serve a different function yet the combination ensures that the balance never shifts in favour of one particular group's interests. All three entities keep each other in check to make sure the power balance is equally distributed. polypoly Enterprise: Creates solutions for entrepreneurs Successful digital business models are based on data. But Europe is losing its data capital to foreign mo- nopolies. European companies are currently dependent, gradually being deprived of access to business models that drive the digital economy. The solution: A decentralised data economy. polypoly Cooperative provides the technical basis – the polyPod. We develop tools and prod- ucts for an easy transition to a decen- tralised data economy. Entrepreneurs will be able to liberate themselves from data monopolies, therefore protecting their existing models and building new digital ones. polypoly Foundation: Understands the needs of public servants Europe is losing its data capital to foreign monopolies. As a result, European companies are cut off from their customers. Citizens data privacy is unprotected, and European states are losing taxpayers‘ money. We assist governments to build a decentralised data economy for Europe. The technical infrastructure is provided by a coop- erative of European citizens using the polyPod. The GDPR is baked into its code. The polyPod efficiently protects European citizens and frees European companies from dependence on data monopolies. It then follows that taxes on profits generated from European data capital are returned to Europe. polypoly Cooperative: Represents the interests of all citizens The core idea of every cooperative is achieving more together. Together we can reclaim sovereignty over our data! We are developing the technical basis for a decentralised data econ- omy: The polyPod, which belongs to all members of the Cooperative. The polyPod is available to all citizens enabling them to reclaim their data sovereignty. The polyPod stores user data on their personal end devices, which it never leaves. Citizens can choose how to make their data availa- ble, whether as a donation or for rent. If money is exchanged the cooperative receives a small percentage which is distributed to all cooperative members.","['Information Technology', 'Internet Services', 'Professional Services', 'Software']",1.0,30.5,Thorsten Dittmar,1,2019-06-02,,Undisclosed,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0,1786,6,11-50,11,50

Elevators are a pain point for their owners: The operation and maintenance costs of the elevator generate some of the highest costs per square feet in the property and elevator downtimes cause extreme user dissatisfaction, high administrative burden for property managers and can even lead to justified rent reductions. Implementing operational obligations, such as maintenance, documentation and repair, lies in the primary responsibility of the property owners. However, due to high cost and often lack of expertise, this happens usually not only inefficiently, but also involves legal risks, for example due to failure to employ maintenance measures. In addition, there is a high information asymmetry between owner / property manager and elevator maintenance company, which often leads to disproportionately high maintenance costs. Simplifa structures, optimizes, and manages elevator portfolios for its customers. The startup serves as a central point of contact for owners and elevator service companies and acts as an expert on an equal footing in negotiations. Each elevator undergoes a technical inspection and is recorded in 360° shots to simulate a virtual “elevator twin”. In the event of system malfunctions, the maintenance company can ensure a much faster and more targeted repair thanks to the ""elevator twin"" without prior dispatch of a technician. Thanks to Simplifa, the operating and maintenance costs of the elevators are regularly reduced by about 30% while maintaining the same quality. In the future, the transmission of sensor data will provide a manufacturer-independent real-time analysis for a predictive maintenance system, which will reduce the manual test frequency of the elevators and avoid costly downtimes in advance.",['Real Estate'],2.0,75.5,"Hubertus von Schierstaedt, Ludwig Busse",2,2018-09-10,,Series A,,"PT1, BitStone Capital",1.0,2.0,0.0,,,,0,OFFLINE,OFFLINE,OFFLINE,OFFLINE,OFFLINE

EM is patented along with 10 + product categories, it provides ever improving digital entertainment and creates immersive clear and intense hi-fi sound. The result is more image added to the sound and an enhanced experience, making all mixing bigger and spacious. Siremix’s products are convenient and bring a number of benefits with extreme simplicity. The 3DPlay, for instance, offers an easy, hassle-free installation. It comes with three easy-to-setup components and does not require an extra number of speakers installed in fixed positions, which makes it independent of the living space layout and dimensions. It is wireless, connecting to all devices via Bluetooth and also offering the standard audio source cable connections. It offers universal compatibility and produces immersive hi-fi sound from any piece of audio in the world. The 3DPlay is a two-in-one product: a powerful high-quality wireless speaker and a soundbar and is highly cost effective because it already comes with a subwoofer. Quality is noticeable on Siremix’s products. The 3DPlay offers superb speakers and high-quality subwoofer, producing loud and consistent sound. It works amazingly with Spatial Audio with VR, adding sound space and reducing motion sickness dramatically. In sum, the 3DPlay offers a mix of excellence and simplicity.  Its strongest assets are the created immersive hi-fi sound, the universal compatibility, the two-in-one product and the outstanding audio performance with VR. The last, offering a significant opportunity for Siremix to enter the VR niche market with competitive advantage. With a drive for quality, Siremix is starting slowly but dreaming high, and aims to develop a range of hi-end products targeted to the audiophiles. In order to get to that level, Siremix is working together with reliable partners. For Siremix’s product design, the company hired the Swedish design and concept development studio BlockZero. The lead industrial designer for the project is Philip Robertson, who has worked internationally at some of the most prestigious agencies, as well as large companies like BlackBerry, and has been the main industrial designer behind projects such as the Skånetrafiken. SEVEN KEY CUSTOMER BENEFITS : 1. He can experience sound with added space and depth, with added sound realism. 2. He can experience sound with added space and depth, with added sound realism.

The produced sound is fantastic because of the high-quality, loudness and consistency of the speakers and the subwoofer. KEY PROBLEM 3DPLAY ADDRESSES: The problem is that the current hi-fi audio products market is usage-limited and does not provide with a full (regarding usage), simple (regarding installation) and cost-effective solution. The problem is that soundbars only improve the TV sound, being a good fit for visual entertainment only. Some brands offer surround sound experience, by providing in-built speakers which point to different directions, but they are usually weak for music playback. They can also provide added components such as rear speakers and a subwoofer to produce the complete surround sound. Those are usually expensive systems. Powerful and high-quality wireless speakers, for instance, are great because they are wireless and some offer deep bass and consistency, but they do not add space and depth to the sound. They are also more adequate/limited to Music playback only. The 3DPlay offers immersive hi-fi sound experience with simplicity. It can be used for Visual Entertainment and Music playback. It already comes with a subwoofer and is highly cost-effective. On top of that, it’s VR-ready and reduces the motion sickness by adding space and depth to the sound/improving sound realism. The 3DPlay creates immersive hi-fi and high-quality sound for the home, adding space and depth to the sound. It performs superbly well with visual entertainment (Movies, Videos, Live Concerts, Gaming and VR) as well as Music playback, producing consistent and loud sound with bass preciseness. It already comes with a subwoofer and for this reason is highly cost-effective. It offers universal compatibility and is VR-ready. It’s a German audio brand (superior quality) and has a stylish Scandinavian design.

Product life cycle management involves making design decisions based on multiple criteria including cost, compliance, sustainability, and risk. Unfortunately, the data and expertise required to make these decisions are siloed. This protracts the process of innovation and increases its complexity.  Today, the market solves this problem with vertical applications like PDM, ERP, CAD, EHS, SCM, etc. These mostly remain siloed due to the enormous costs of integration and keeping data synchronized. Therefore, analyses typically require exporting data to aggregation tools e.g. BI or excel before being used for analyses in specialist decision support applications. Results are typically delayed, some taking as much as 9 months, and therefore provide little support during the design process. Makersite provides results instantly and simultaneously across key product criteria. Makersite combines external and internal data sources to create a digital twin of a product in design. Artificial intelligence and its graph-based data model allow for ingesting, representing, and connecting heterogeneous data easily. Its native applications use algorithms to support analysis and decision-making based on multiple criteria simultaneously including should-costs, regulatory compliance, life cycle impacts (LCA), supply chain risk, etc. The API-first architecture allows for easy integrations into existing IT infrastructures thereby supporting systems and processes with richer, fresher, and more timely product data. This allows engineers to understand and improve their designs from the perspective of their regulatory compliance, environmental impact, supply risk, and cost of production, simultaneously. Companies can get results up to 40x faster than traditional methods while making their products better.","['Artificial Intelligence (AI)', 'Data and Analytics', 'Design', 'Information Technology', 'Other', 'Professional Services', 'Software', 'Transportation']",1.0,75.5,Neil Dsouza,5,2022-10-18,18200000.0,Series A,18031896.0,"Translink Capital, EASME, Planet A Ventures, Hitachi Ventures, KOMPAS VC",4.0,7.0,0.0,,,,0,8637,91,51-200,51,200

The focus of our work is on developing conversational interfaces based on artificial intelligence that enable companies to automate customer communication. The Chatbot Solution called moinAI is a SaaS-Product developed by knowhere. moinAI is a self-learning AI chatbot solution for digital customer communication of companies. No matter if marketing, sales or customer service - moinAI is the automation solution that helps to react quickly and efficiently to customer requests around the clock. Depending on the use case, this results in benefits such as increased customer satisfaction, more automated leads, an increased conversion rate and a reduction in support volume.    Numerous companies from various industries have already optimized their customer communication with moinAI. These include Geberit, Velux, Abus, Der Spiegel and Dräger. The bandwidth of use cases ranges from first level support to marketing campaigns up to e-commerce strategies and many more. However, one thing is true for each of the above-mentioned use cases: the impressive KPIs resulting from automation.    What makes moinAI so special is its ability to learn on its own. The so-called self-learning works by means of several AI-principles and ensures that moinAI is a self-runner in the truest sense of the word. Once the AI chatbot has been trained by us and implemented at the respective company, no further and costly training sessions on the part of the company are required. In addition, the language understanding is Natural-Language-Processing-based (NLP-based), which means that the AI does not understand user queries on the basis of keywords, but instead identifies semantic relationships, which makes it possible to understand long and complicated sentences. Through NLP and AI, moinAI therefore understands even complex messages and learns independently with each user conversation. Thus moinAI offers a system that grows with the needs and requirements of the company.","['Artificial Intelligence (AI)', 'Data and Analytics', 'Information Technology', 'Internet Services', 'Messaging and Telecommunications', 'Sales and Marketing', 'Science and Engineering', 'Software']",5.0,30.5,"Florian Nommensen, Markus Bröcker, Patrick Zimmermann, Robert Weber, Sebastian Schmitt",1,2015-09-01,,Non-equity Assistance,,SpinLab - The HHL Accelerator,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,0,2707,29,11-50,11,50
