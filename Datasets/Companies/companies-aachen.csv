And that for many years: because the solutions are designed to be future-proof so that you benefit from regular updates and the highest level of investment protection. Our solution consists of the nevisCura bed and room sensor. The bed sensor from nevisCura is an intelligent bed exit alarm that noticeably facilitates the daily work of caregivers. Once attached to the bed in just a few steps, the silent guard discreetly signals when a resident wants to get out of bed - even before he or she has set foot on the floor. And best of all: the sensor is compatible with every common call system. The room sensor from nevisCura is an innovative sensor system that is used for fall detection and prevention in outpatient and inpatient care facilities. Once installed all around at the height of the base boards, it offers the greatest protection for residents and noticeably relieves caregivers.","Hardware, Health Care, Internet Services, Software",4,11-50,"Christian Kind, David Link, Dennis Breuer, Stelios Katsanevakis",5,Early Stage Venture,2020-01-10,,,,Series A,,,,Series A,125000,EUR,135816,175000,EUR,194872,"EIT Health, European Data Incubator, Schürfeld Group",3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,1
