But they don't have any tool to manage and prioritise the organisation's time. When which group of participants works together on which topic is controlled exclusively by structural specifications. We are convinced that in a knowledge-driven economy, the use of time to create value must be digitised and automated. Therefor Scedule goes beyond the known scope of scheduling tools: A smart algorithm identifies meaningful date proposals that take into account specific business preferences. Resource bookings in linked groupware are made automatically and in advance according to the schedule. The Scedule API enables the integration of ready-to-use applications into company-specific collaboration tools.
