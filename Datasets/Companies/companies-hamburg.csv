The whole thing is because there are no classic EIAs in the kitchen area. There are so-called list prices, which can then be manipulated from kitchen house to kitchen house according to preference.

The focus of our work is on developing conversational interfaces based on artificial intelligence that enable companies to automate customer communication. The Chatbot Solution called moinAI is a SaaS-Product developed by knowhere. moinAI is a self-learning AI chatbot solution for digital customer communication of companies. No matter if marketing, sales or customer service - moinAI is the automation solution that helps to react quickly and efficiently to customer requests around the clock. Depending on the use case, this results in benefits such as increased customer satisfaction, more automated leads, an increased conversion rate and a reduction in support volume.    Numerous companies from various industries have already optimized their customer communication with moinAI. These include Geberit, Velux, Abus, Der Spiegel and Dräger. The bandwidth of use cases ranges from first level support to marketing campaigns up to e-commerce strategies and many more. However, one thing is true for each of the above-mentioned use cases: the impressive KPIs resulting from automation.    What makes moinAI so special is its ability to learn on its own. The so-called self-learning works by means of several AI-principles and ensures that moinAI is a self-runner in the truest sense of the word. Once the AI chatbot has been trained by us and implemented at the respective company, no further and costly training sessions on the part of the company are required. In addition, the language understanding is Natural-Language-Processing-based (NLP-based), which means that the AI does not understand user queries on the basis of keywords, but instead identifies semantic relationships, which makes it possible to understand long and complicated sentences. Through NLP and AI, moinAI therefore understands even complex messages and learns independently with each user conversation. Thus moinAI offers a system that grows with the needs and requirements of the company.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Sales and Marketing, Science and Engineering, Software",5,11-50,"Florian Nommensen, Markus Bröcker, Patrick Zimmermann, Robert Weber, Sebastian Schmitt",1,,2015-09-01,,,,Non-equity Assistance,,,,,,,,,,,SpinLab - The HHL Accelerator,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,
