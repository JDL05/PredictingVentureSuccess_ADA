It is actually the reason, why this industry is the second biggest producer of wasted food in our society, after private households. An owner of a canteen needs to know the right meals, number of dishes and guests. The right combination is complex. The result is overstocking and overproduction, which means higher food cost for the canteen. On average 1 of the 44.000 German canteens loses 50k € every year.  With Mitakus we develop a software to help owners to reduce food cost, by providing them a demand forecast, which is integrated into systems that they are already using.  Essentially, you can imagine our solution as a web browser plugin, only that we build a plugin into cash registers and planning software. The owner receives our prediction and knows how much to prepare and order. Thus, we can help reduce the food cost by up to 40% and charge a commission on that, creating a win-win situation.","Data and Analytics, Software",,1-10,,1,,2019-05-25,,,,Undisclosed,,,,Undisclosed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Among an innovative software solution, the marketplace is matching clients and freelancing call center agents whom we call talents. Through the concept, the platform provides a solution to work as a freelancing talent globally. Moreover, the provided technology enables the possibility for the talents to work from home. Additionally, a customer‘s project can be implemented efficiently, individually, and flexibly. Next to a talent pool with above 20,000 registered talents, yoummday offers managed services for corporate clients, as well as a self-managing possibility. Both services are allowing the client to monitor the project in real-time based on personally defined KPI‘s. By giving talents up to 80% of the revenue, the motivation is increasing, because the freelancing talent is earning twice as much as a call center agent in their country they live in. The client only has to pay a yoummday provision as well as the talent remuneration which is leading to cost savings up to 40%. Furthermore, yoummday is responsible for training and quality checks which are regularly analyzed and individually modified.
