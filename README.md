## 📚 About the Project

The objective of this project is to predict the success of startups in the core startup ecosystems of Germany. Therefore, we collected data from the startup-database [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com) and scraped social media data from LinkedIn and X/Twitter. To reach the projects objective, we applied a Machine Learning Pipeline and selected a row of models to predict the binary success variable. We selected from classical methods (Logistic Regression / Gradient Boosting / Light GBM / Neural Network), new emerging models like the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN) and Large Language Models (distilBERT). The projects results are explained in a research paper and presented in a React-coded Dashboard.
