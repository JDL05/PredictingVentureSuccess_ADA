# 🚀 Predicting Venture Success

✨ **Brief description:** We use Cruchbase and Social Media data to predict the success of startups with classical Machine Learning models, a new foundation model called TabPFN and Large Language Models.

## 📚 About the Project

The objective of this project is to predict the success of startups in the core startup ecosystems of Germany. Therefore, we collected data from the startup-database [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com) and scraped social media data from LinkedIn and X/Twitter. To reach the projects objective, we applied a Machine Learning Pipeline and selected a row of models to predict the binary success variable. We selected from classical methods (Logistic Regression / Gradient Boosting / Light GBM / Neural Network), new emerging models like the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN) and Large Language Models (distilBERT). The projects results are explained in a research paper and presented in a React-coded Dashboard.

## 🔢 Data Files

All data files needed to process the code are stored in the 'Datasets'-Directory. To use them, the entire directories have to be downloaded. In the code, every files are read with the use of a wildcard in the filepaths (/*.csv). 

The following data sets / directories are needed to run the code:

1. 'Companies'
2. 'Funding'
3. 'Investors'
